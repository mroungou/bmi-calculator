        <p>
          Better understand your weight in relation to your height using our
          body mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is not the sole determinant
          of a healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting point to evaluate
          your overall health and well-being.

      <h3>What your BMI result means</h3>
      <p>
        A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a
        healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on,
        such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced
        fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally,
        strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for
        five days a week.

          <h3>Healthy eating</h3>
          <p>
            Healthy eating promotes weight control, disease prevention, better digestion,
            immunity, mental clarity, and mood.

        <div class="exercise">
          <img src="./assets/images/icon-exercise.svg" alt="">
          <h3>Regular exercise</h3>
          <p>
            Exercise improves fitness, aids weight control, elevates mood, and reduces disease
            risk, fostering wellness and longevity.

          <img src="./assets/images/icon-sleep.svg" alt="" srcset="">
          <h3>Adequate sleep</h3>
          <p>
            Sleep enhances mental clarity, emotional stability, and physical wellness, promoting
            overall restoration and rejuvenation.

      <h3>Limitations of BMI</h3>
      <p>
        Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for
        every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in
        certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.
      </p>

            <h4>Gender</h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently,
            a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="age">
          <div class="test1">
            <img src="./assets/images/icon-age.svg" alt="">
            <h4>Age</h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate
            body fat content.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="muscle">
          <div class="test1">
            <img src="./assets/images/icon-muscle.svg" alt="" srcset="">
            <h4>Muscle</h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't
            differentiate muscle from fat.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="preg">

            <h4>Pregnancy</h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby. Maintaining a
            healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise health risks for both mother
            and child.

            Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at
            lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this with your
            GP or practice nurse.
